For our Computer Graphics Exam I have been tasked with enhancing Mario Land 3 with Shaders. 

1st shader
For the first shader I included was a stencil shader. This stencil was very useful for this scene. I wanted to try and show a broken down 
warehouse/building. The stencil shader allows me to do this without complicated geomtery in modelling. It enhances the scene with complex looking
"Geomtry" When really its just covering up those pieces. I like how it looks broken down without as much effort.

2nd shader 
For the second shader I included the vertex extrusion shader for polygon surface deformation. I did not have time to properly input coding but my plan for this 
shader would be to increase warios midsection when he collects the donuts. Similarly to the orginal game when he bulks upo to twice his size when he eats a donut but I added
a comical twist for a humor aspect as it is a game for all ages and Wario, although "evil" is often viewed in a comical way! * I include my early version of this idea and my final version of this idea.

EARLY VERSION:

FiNAL VERSION:

For the final version I modified the script so that it includes both the vertex extrusion and the toon shading the rest if him has!
I have attached my code with starred changes:

3rd shdaer: 
The thrid shader incluided along side he vertex extrusion shader was the toon shader. The toon shader felt most appriorate to rekindle the same feeling the orignal
cartoon style game has. I felt hyper realistic shading or graphics would feel out of place in this game. I have the toon shading applied in 2 areas:
firstly it is applied
to Wario; my creative choice to make him golden was based on 2 things. 1. the model I downloaded was poorly spilt up and 2. While looking at game references I saw "Wario Statues" from other Wario games
therefore felt fitting to add as an easter egg to other wario game players.

Secondly a modified version of the toon shader has been implemented on to the ground
